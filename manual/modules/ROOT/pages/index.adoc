== Description

The e_timer plugin is a simple Count_up/Count_down timer that includes an alarm for the watch hours (0400..0800 etc). It has been found useful for single-handing. 

A normal kitchen timer will sound for a short time and then stop. It is easy to return to sleep without getting up and it is even possible to ignore the alarm. 

e_timer makes this difficult. The alarm used is the same as the anchor alarm from the main OpenCPN program. 

== Standard actions
